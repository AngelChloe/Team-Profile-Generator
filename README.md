# User Story
AS A manager
I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles
  
  
## Description
Your task is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Testing is key to making code maintainable, so you’ll also write a unit test for every part of your code and ensure that it passes each test.

## Acceptance Criteria
- When given a command-line application that accepts user input
- I am prompted for my team members and their information
- Then an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
- When I click on an email address in the HTML
- Then my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
- I click on the GitHub username
- The GitHub profile opens in a new tab
- I start the application
- I am prompted to enter the Teamlead’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
- I enter the Teamlead’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
- I am presented with a menu with the option to add an TaskEnforcer or an intern or to finish building my team
- I select the engineer option
- I am prompted to enter the TaskEnforce’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
- I select the intern option
- I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
- When I decide to finish building my team
- I exit the application, and the HTML is generated
